Command Line Interface
************************

Use of the command line divides into two categories:

1. as the root user
2. as the django-pbx user

Most of the commands can be issued as the django-pbx user but
a few, such as firewall commands and starting and stopping services,
must be issued as root.

The following sections detail various command line utilities and
useful commands.
