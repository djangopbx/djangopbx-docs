Admin Interface
*****************

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the **Admin** interface.
DjangoPBX utilises the Admin interface to provide access to all the
data models.  Each model represents a table in the database.

The Admin interface easily accommodates most of the DjangoPBX requirements
However a very few operations require a more process-centric interface
that abstracts away the implementation details of database tables and fields.
These actions are provided via the user portal interface.
