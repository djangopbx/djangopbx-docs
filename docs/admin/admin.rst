Admin Interface
#################

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the **Admin Interface**.
DjangoPBX utilises the **Admin Interface** to provide access to all the
data models.  Each model represents a table in the database.

The **Admin Interface** easily accommodates most of the DjangoPBX requirements.
However a small number of operations require a more process-centric interface
that abstracts away the implementation details of database tables and fields.
These actions are provided via the user portal interface.
