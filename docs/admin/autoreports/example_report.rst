When view report is clicked the system will generate the report in real time and
 display the results.  This can be helpful when prototyping new reports.  This screen
will alsoo let you know if there were any errors in generating the report.


The Edit Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Auto Reports** edit screen has several sections, the main window and
a collapsible section for update detail.

There is also a **Auto Report Section** section that allows any number of
report sections to be added.  Each report section has it's own SQL query.

It may be helpful to refer to the :doc:`../../architecture/db_entity_relationship_diagram`
or the :doc:`../../architecture/db_schema` documents when constructing
your SQL query.
