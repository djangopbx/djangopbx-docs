**DjangoPBX** is a project to provide a GUI configuration
and management interface around FreeSWITCHâ„¢ using Django
and the Python language.

DjangoPBX is **completely open source** and basically does two things:

1. It provides a portal for end users and device configuration.
2. It generates FreeSITCH configuration from the data you provide in the Admin interface.
